<h2 class="text-center">One Year Birthday!</h2>
<div class="pull-right">February 20, 2015</div><div class="clearfix"></div><br>

<p>&mdash; Wow, it's been a whole year [plus two days] since this website was created (well, one year since the original
version of this website, "Terrell's Transit Directions," anyways). It's crazy to imagine this,
because this started off of some sort of impulse I had back in the Summer of 2013, posting
Google Docs to the Facebook group as directions to certain events. There were a lot of different
attempts at doing that:</p><br>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Attempt 1:</strong> Simple Google Docs 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13RavbH-0hJYAG9M_wqUBL5ILc602v-MiMX2zruvy1lo/pub">[Directions to the 2013 Kiwanis Family Picnic]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Attempt 2:</strong> Added Service Changes 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IZfzQqeaE6yevvdMSzRi-I5u5uVor9Ez41caWmBk_I8/pub">[Directions to Nov. 1-3, 2013 events]</a></li>
  <li><strong>Attempt 3:</strong> Separated Service Changes 
  <a href="http://bit.ly/bskc20131109breakthrough">[Directions to Breakthrough for Brain Tumors 5K 2013]</a></li>
</ul>
<em>(Note that Attempt 3 looks a lot like this website in terms of layout.)</em><br>
<br>
<p>Eventually, I got tired of editing annoying Google Docs that would not always publish. That, and
I wanted to include Google Maps on the page itself. So I bothered then-Stuyvesant Key Club Webmaster
Danny Qiu about making a website to host these directions. Then, on February 18, 2014, I was able to
make this website. (This was back when I sucked at web design -- look at the original layout <a href="/resources/mtaguyscreenshot.png">[here]</a>)</p><br>
<p>I never thought that over 1,200 unique users (according to Google Analytics, it's definitely a bit lower) would view this website over 7,900 times.
And I never thought that I could contribute something to a community of super-dedicated Key Club members.</p><br>
<p>I'm glad that my original mission of getting people to attend more events by showing them how to
get there was able to be lived out, even as I am currently 400 miles away in the cold city of Rochester, 
New York. And yes, I will do this until the end of the service year (so the end of next month). After that,
we'll see. But it's been fun.</p><br>
<p>You all are great Key Clubbers, and I'm glad that I've been able to serve you all in this way.</p><br>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> The most used event page was the directions to the <a href="/2014/04/19/Amazing_Race/">2014 Amazing Race</a>, with 595 page views!</p>
