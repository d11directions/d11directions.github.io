<h2>About The Website:</h2>
<p>This website was created noting that many Key Club members were not motivated to go to events because of how inaccesible many of them are. In an attempt to increase attendance at the various events by members of Division 11, this website hosts directions to as many events as possible in an attempt to convince more people to attend these events.</p>

<h4>Terrell Frederick Merritt, <em>Website Creator</em></h4>
<img class="aboutpic" src="/resources/terrellmerritt.png">
<p>Currently a first-year in the Computer Science major at the <a href="rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a> and Social Media Committee Chair of its corresponding Circle K chapter, I am an alum of <a href="bxscience.edu">The Bronx High School of Science</a> (Class of 2014) and its corresponding <a href="bxscikeyclub.weebly.com">Key Club</a> chapter. As a member of Bronx Science Key Club, I was the 2014 <a href="nydkc.org">New York District Key Club</a> Distinguished Senior Key Club Member award recipient.</p>
<p>I built this website, with a significant amount of help from District Webmaster Danny Qiu, in an attempt to use something I'm good at (transportation directions) to bring more people to something I love (Key Club). I hope that this website serves its purpose in bringing more Key Club members to events that are not necessarily three blocks away from their homes. Even as my tenure in Key Club has passed, I want to be able to bring the members of the Key Club I left behind to more events.</p>
