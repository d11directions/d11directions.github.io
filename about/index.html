  <h2>About The Website:</h2>
  <p>This website was created noting that many Key Club members were not motivated to go to events because of how inaccesible many of them are. In an attempt to increase attendance at the various events by members of Division 11, this website hosts directions to as many events as possible in an attempt to convince more people to attend these events.</p>

  I built this website, with a significant amount of help from District Webmaster Danny Qiu, in an attempt to use something I'm good at (transportation directions) to bring more people to something I love (Key Club). I hope that this website serves its purpose in bringing more Key Club members to events that are not necessarily three blocks away from their homes.</p>
