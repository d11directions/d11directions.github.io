<h2>Terrell Frederick Merritt</h2>
<h5>2014-2015 Department Chair, Division 11 Department of Transit &amp; Directions<br>
2013-2014 Distinguished Senior Member<br>
New York District Division 11, Bronx High School of Science Key Club</h5>
<img class="aboutpic" src="/resources/terrellmerritt.png"><p>I built this website, with a significant amount of help from District Webmaster Danny Qiu, in an attempt to use something I'm good at (transportation directions) to bring more people to something I love (Key Club). I hope that this website serves its purpose in bringing more Key Club members to events that are not necessarily three blocks away from their homes.</p>
