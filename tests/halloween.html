<h2>About The Website:</h2>
<p>This website was created on February 18, 2014 as "<a href="http://terrellthemtaguy.github.io/">Terrell's Transit
Directions</a>", providing transit directions to Bronx Science Key Club members as a replacement for Google Documents
links providing the same service. Eventually this service was expanded to cover the entirety of Division 11 of New
York District Key Club. The creation occurred while noting that many Key Club members were not motivated to go to
events because of how inaccesible many of them are by public transportation. In an attempt to increase attendance at
the various events by members of Division 11, this website hosts directions to as many events as possible to convince more people to attend these events.</p>

<p>I built this website, with assistance from Past District Webmaster Danny Qiu, in an attempt to use something I'm good at (transportation directions) to bring more people to something I love (Key Club). I hope that this website serves its purpose in bringing more Key Club members to events that are not necessarily three blocks away from their homes. Even as my tenure in Key Club has passed, I want to be able to bring the members of the Key Club I left behind to more events.</p>
