## History ##
This website (in its original incarnation) was created by Terrell Frederick Merritt
in February 2014 in order to address the lack of attendance at events by members of
his chapter of Key Club International due to not understanding how to utilize
public transportation to get there. Mixing his vast knowledge of the New York City
Subway system and his limited-but-expanding knowledge in Computer Science and Web
Development, Terrell created *Terrell's Transit Directions* to provide transit
directions in an easy to access location. The name was shortly changed to *Division
11 Transit Directions* to reflect a larger audience (targeting more local Key Club
chapters, collectively known as New York District's Division 11) and to calm down
Terrell's ego. This website's existence and use by the membership of Division 11
led to the formation of the Division 11 Department of Transit & Directions, chaired
by Terrell and giving the website a formalized use which lasted until March 2015 - 
more than a half-year after Terrell became an alumni of Key Club International and 
began his collegiate studies.
